# Numverical-Shrodinger-Solver
This MATLAB function is designed solve the Schr√∂dinger equation using finite difference method. It simulates quantum systems with different potential wells (Infinite Square Well, Finite Square Well, Harmonic Oscillator), generating numerical and graphical wavefunction results for each.
